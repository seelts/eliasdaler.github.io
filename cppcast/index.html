Listen to it <a href=http://cppcast.com/2016/07/elias-daler>here</a>.</p><p>Here are my some thoughts about CppCast and the episode.</p><p></p><h2 id=about-cppcast>About CppCast</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re never heard of <strong>CppCast</strong> before - it&rsquo;s one of the most amazing podcasts ever! The guests are always interesting and the discussions are very informative. The hosts know what to ask and what to talk about - they&rsquo;re C++ developers themselves.
They also get awesome guests on the show. For example, there are episodes with people like <a href=http://cppcast.com/2015/09/scott-meyers/>Scott Meyers</a>, <a href=http://cppcast.com/2015/10/andrei-alexandrescu/>Andrei Alexandrescu</a> and <a href=http://cppcast.com/2016/06/herb-sutter/>Herb Sutter</a>. These people are my heroes of programming, so it&rsquo;s a big pleasure to be interviewed on the podcast of that caliber.</p><h2 id=episode-with-me>Episode with me</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve never expected to be on the show so soon. I&rsquo;ve joked about it: &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;ll be there in <em>X</em> years when I get really successful&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a big honor for me and I&rsquo;m very thankful for Rob and Jason for making my dream of being on podcast come true.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I come of kinda derpy or awkward at times during the interview. First of all, I was pretty nervous and secondly, English is not my native language and I don&rsquo;t speak in it in real life at all.
But still, I think I did pretty well and we discussed lots of neat stuff during the episode.</p><h2 id=if-you-want-to-learn-about-luac-integration-andor-read-my-other-blog-posts>If you want to learn about Lua/C++ integration and/or read my other blog posts</h2><p>This is my new blog, so check out my <a href=https://eliasdaler.wordpress.com>old blog</a> for all the mentioned articles. If you want to start with Lua and C++, check out <a href=https://eliasdaler.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/using-lua-with-cpp-luabridge/>LuaBridge tutorial</a> (though I recommend to use <a href=https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2>sol2</a> as a binding library). If you want to see how you can use Lua in Practice, check out <a href=https://eliasdaler.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/using-lua-and-cpp-in-practice/>Using Lua in practice</a> articles (there are five of them!). And check out <a href=https://eliasdaler.wordpress.com/tag/dev-log/>Re:creation dev logs</a> for in-depth explanation of what I did about the game and how I make my game engine.</p><p>The new articles are coming very soon, check out what I&rsquo;m planning to write <a href=https://eliasdaler.github.io/first-post>here</a> (I promised that there&rsquo;ll be some when the podcast airs, but I didn&rsquo;t think that episode will come out so soon, so sorry about that). I think these articles will be even better, there&rsquo;s a lot of things I&rsquo;ve learned during the last few years.</p><p>Thanks for reading and listening. Please let me know what you thought of the episode in the comments!</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Â© 2022 Elias Daler.
